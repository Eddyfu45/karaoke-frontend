Once you select the karaoke version you want, you'll be taken to the record page where you can record and then upload your new hit! Don't like what you did? Simply turn back time and try again. You don't have to sing a song by Cher, but are you really living life to the fullest if you don't?

## Next Steps

Music is a social experience, and the next iterations of Cheraoke will embrace this. Here are just a few of the many plans we have for future versions of this app:

- We intend to build in the ability to follow other users.
- Allow different people to sing and/or comment in real-time using Firebase to synchronize events across clients.
- Enable users to upload portfolio pics.
